/* Welcome to the SQL mini project. You will carry out this project partly in
the PHPMyAdmin interface, and partly in Jupyter via a Python connection.

This is Tier 2 of the case study, which means that there'll be less guidance for you about how to setup
your local SQLite connection in PART 2 of the case study. This will make the case study more challenging for you: 
you might need to do some digging, aand revise the Working with Relational Databases in Python chapter in the previous resource.

Otherwise, the questions in the case study are exactly the same as with Tier 1. 

PART 1: PHPMyAdmin
You will complete questions 1-9 below in the PHPMyAdmin interface. 
Log in by pasting the following URL into your browser, and
using the following Username and Password:

URL: https://sql.springboard.com/
Username: student
Password: learn_sql@springboard

The data you need is in the "country_club" database. This database
contains 3 tables:
    i) the "Bookings" table,
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    iii) the "Members" table.

In this case study, you'll be asked a series of questions. You can
solve them using the platform, but for the final deliverable,
paste the code for each solution into this script, and upload it
to your GitHub.

Before starting with the questions, feel free to take your time,
exploring the data, and getting acquainted with the 3 tables. */

Write a SQL query to produce a list of the names of the facilities that do. */

facilities in question. */

in question. */
